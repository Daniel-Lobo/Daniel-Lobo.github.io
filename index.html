                    </h3>       
                    <br>This version was 1st released as a beta as several things on Windows were broken, and while some still are, I decided to promote it
                    to stable anyway because the biggest hold-ups with the transition were that the UI had to be re-written, as the old one used technologies 
                    that don't work on Wine, and that I had to switch to a new compiler, but with those out of the way, the few things that remain to be fixed,
                    should be fixed soon<br>
                    Here's what has been fixed\added
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Windows:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11:</b> <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine's</a>, or optionally
                                <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases">dxvk's</a> Direct3D implementations are now used                                
                                <li><b>Direct3D 10 and 11:</b> Forced resolution is finally starting to have a half decent compatibility. Some games can already
                                benefit from super sampling anti-aliasing and on Inside, I modified the SSAA downsampling step so it won't use filtering
                                fixing the blur caused by temporal anti-aliasing</li>                                   
                                <li><b>DirectX 7 and earlier:</b> <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine's</a> dlls not yet adopted, but
                                as a step towards the transition, I had to remove the Direct3D user mode display driver hooks, which were responsible for things like fixing
                                w-fog, xBRz scaling, deinterlacing, forcing\disabling texture filter and therefore these features are currently not implemented</li>                                  
                                </li> 
                                <li><b>Direct3D 12:</b> removed FSR support, so for now there are no Direct3D 12 features at all</li>  
                                <li><b>DirectSound:</b> <strike>Just before release, I noticed the directsound hooks were broken, so I disabled all features. This was caused by the
                                    transition to MingW (I'm suspecting a bad header) and should be fixed soon</strike>. Fixed a few hours after release
                                </li>  
                                <li><b>DirectInput:</b> <strike>Another victim of the transition from the visual studio to MingW and the fix doesn't seem simple for now DirectInput to  
                                    XInput translation is disabled</strike>. Fixed
                                </li>

                        <li><b>Deprecations:</b> Some games were <i>"deprecated"</i>. I can't test over 50 games every time I make a change that can affect said games, 
                        so I'm keeping only my favorites and deprecating some. This means that I don't test or offer support for these games anymore, but their profiles
                        are still included and warnings were added for each deprecated game with the last patch version 
                        it was tested with. So far, I only deprecated DirectX 7 and earlier games. Deprecated games never use the passtrought layer, you'll have to

                    <h3>   
                    I took my time creating a lot of new cheat tables, it helps with testing, specially with EAX that requires visiting
                    diferent areas of the game. Almost every supported game now has a cheat table and EAX - versions 1, 2 and 3 - now 
                    have a pretty decent compatibility, reverb and muffleling. Here are a few other updates:</h3>   
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Max Payne 2 added:</b> Benefits from forced resolution\super sampling anti-aliasing and EAX emulation</li>
                        <li><b>Direct3D 11:</b> added forced triple buffering</li>  
                        <li><b>Opengl:</b> fixed the glreadpixels hook. This affects the save game thumbnais on Munch's oddysee when SSAA is enabled</li>  
                        <li><b>DirectInput:</b> Fixed a bug on the IDirectInputDevice::GetEffectStatus method. With this, force feedback now works correctly on star wars racer</li>          
                        <li><b>Prince of persia 3D:</b> Fixed a bug that caused the screen not to be cleared before FMV playback</li>
                        <li><b>Munch's Oddysse:</b> The <i>fix window size</i> option is now enabled by default, fixing some crashes</li>
                        <li><b>Revenant:</b> The map now works correctly on hardware mode. The map normally doesn't work on hardware mode because
                               the game tries to use a system memory texture to render it. The fix is implemented by copying the texture 
                               data to a hardware texture and will be made available in future updates as an option to be applied to any game</li>
                        <li><b>Silver:</b> Added 60 fps limitation, fixing a lot of bugs</li>
                        <li><b>Save redirection:</b> The <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-getenvironmentstrings'>

                    </h3>                    
                    <h3>DIRECTINPUT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Fixed the reporting of the analog sticks position which as broken in many games  
                        <li> Fixed mapping of the thumbsticks buttons, which could be mapped to a different DirectInput button as the one intended
                        <li> Added support for games the use custom data formats to retrieve gamepad data
                        <li> Added support for games the retrieve buffered data instead of immediate data 
                        <li> Improved force feedback support. I know very little games that use force feedback, so this didn't have a lot of testing
                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>OPENGL</h3>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed bugs on the glDrawPixels and glBitmap hooks, Affects Strangers Wrath and blade of darkness
                        <li>Fixed super sampling anti aliasing, affects Alone in the Dark, Sphinyx, Strangers Wrath and maybe others  
                    </ul>      
                        
                    <h3>DIRECT9</h3>  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed a bug rendering texts - used to search for texture and shaders - on Direct3D9Ex
                        <li>Broke &#x1F610 texture swapping in half life 2

                    <h3>ALL GRAPHICS APIS</h3> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Fixed a bug on the EnumDisplaySettingsExW Hook. When enumerating the current resolution, this function would return the display height 
                        incorrectly - equal to the width. I found this bug while setting forced resolution on Hyper Light Drifter, a game that doesn't need forced 
                        resolution, but I aways test all games I play to improve compatibility
                        <li>Added a GetMessagePos hook. This is used to report the mouse position 'correctly' when forced resolution is enabled       
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>mciSendCommand: MCI_STATUS (track position), would return position of the next track when time format was milisseconds
                        <li>mciSendCommand: MCI_PLAY would play the wrong track when time format was milisseconds, this fixes shadows of the empire

                    <h3>FILE REDIRECTION</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Fixed bugs on the SHGetKnownFolderPath and SHGetFolderLocation hooks
                        <li> New hooks to handle games the retrieve the special folders path from environment variables 
                    </ul>   
                    
                    <h3>GAME SPECIFIC FIXES</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Wheel of time, fixed a bug on FMV playback that caused the audio the game was playing before the FMV start, to continue playing  
                        <li>Rainworld, fixed some incorrect values on the ini file which prevented the unfiltered upscaling from working   
                    </ul>   
                                        
                    <h3>NEW GAMES</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>5 games that have cheat tables and nothing else: Guacamelee 1 and 2, Ori 1 and 2 and Iconoclasts
                        <li>3 Games the benefit from forced resolution and also have cheat tables: SIGNALIS, Sphinyx and the cursed mummy and Star trek Klingon honor guard.
                        The last benefits from several other fixed ass well
                    </ul>      
                
                    <h3>OTHER</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Restored compatibility with windows 7. The previous version required Win 8  and latter, this happened in the migration of the build system from 
                            Qt creator\Qmake to Visual Studio\Cmake, but is fixed now
                        <li>The GUI now runs on top of MS edge instead of Qt's webengine. This reduces the download size from about 50 MB to 5 MB  
                        <li> Createprocess hook, When a 32 bit program launches a 64 bit program, the injector fails to 'inject' peixoto's patch on the child program, this wasn't
                        entirely fixed, but at least in won't prevent the child program from 
                        starting, this fixes freezing on TR reboot
                    </ul>      
                
                    <h3>CHEAT TABLES</h3>

                    <h1 class='tile'>May, 31, 2022, Small update</h1>
                    <p> This is still Version 0.10.8, as none of the binaries or scripts were altered. 
                        I've just updated the Cheat Engine cheat tables - and the accompanying scripts  
                        that run with my Cheat Engine AutoHotkey plugin - to make them more consistent. 
                        Now all tables have, as much as possible, similar cheats and hotkeys. The most
                        common cheats are:</p>
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Infinite HP
                        <li>Easy Kills: this is 1 hit kills on most games, but on some - guacamelee, Control - it is 2 hits, 
                            and on others - soul reaver - is more complicated 
                        <li>Infinite Ammo or Magic
                        <li>Gain currency: money, XP, etc. You press a key to gain a certain amount of
                          currency. On games that have some kind of currency, this is the best way to 
                          implement a cheat: it is easy to code, and you don't have to acquire any 
                          amount of currency before using the cheat
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cheat tables are gonna be a thing on Peixoto's patch, many more are coming in
                    the future, the ones included now are:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Control - DX11 and DX12, only inf HP and easy kill at the moment
                        <li> DeusEx 
                        <li> Guacamelee!

                        <li> Ori and the blind forest
                        <li> Return to castle wolfenstein - inf ammo broken
                        <li> Septerra core - missing inf HP at the moment

                    <p> This update focused mostly on the texture swap option. I wanted do to a big  
                        refactoring, share as much code as possible between all the APIs, implement the
                        auto dump option for all the APIs and solve bugs. In the end, I've made less 
                        then I originally intended to, because it was taking to long and I really want t
                        o focus on the passthought layers next. Regardless, a lot was done in this 
                        update</p>
                    
                    <p>    Starting with some additions</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>DirectX7:</b> Added the "Alpha textures fix" option. This was created to fix fonts
                          on Blade of darkness and may solve other bugs on other games that use alpha 
                          only textures. The correct rendering of fonts on Blade of darkness depends on 
                          alpha textures returning 1.0 for the color channels when sampled on the pixel 
                          stage. With the introduction of the programable pipeline, 
                          <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/texld---ps-2-0'>
                          the default  value of the color channels in alpha only textures on the pixel shader was set
                          to 0.0.</a> On windows vista - and latter,
                          <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/converting-the-direct3d-fixed-function-state'>
                          the  Direct3D runtimes implement the fixed function pipeline with shaders</a>
                         
                          What I'm guessing happened here was that, at that point, the MS programers did not 
                          correctly replicated the fixed function alpha textures behavior on the pixel 
                          shaders emulating the fixed function pipeline.   
                          This fix is applied by replacing alpha only textures with full RGBA textures 
                          with the color channels set to 255.
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX7 and earlier:</b> Replaced the "FMV fix" option with the "GDI hooks" 
                          option. The old video for windows API, as well as the earliest DirectShow 
                          versions and also quicktime output video using GDI. The old "FMV fix" option
                          hooked 2 GDI functions - BitBlt and StretchBlt - to correctly upscale the FMVs 
                          when forced resolution is enabled, on games using these APIs. The hooks were 
                          now expanded - PatBlt, TextOutA and ExtTextOutA - to fix the menus on 
                          Hyperblade. I find unlikely that this will matter for other games. The 
                          Hyperblade demo is a Win16 program. So the game was probably Win16 GDI and 
                          was ported to Win32 Direct3D close to launch, keeping the existing code for 
                          the menus. Latter DirectDraw\Direct3D games DO use GDI A LOT, but they use GDI 
                          to draw on a DirectDraw surface, and this is already handled
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX7 and earlier:</b> New Win32 hooks. When forced resolution is enabled, some 
                          Win32 functions the game my call to retrieve the display resolution or window 
                          size are hooked. DirectDraw\Direct3D games don't use this a lot, so it was 
                          always handle case by case with game specific scripts. Now a set hooks with 
                          code common for all APIs is used. A common set of hooks is also used by the
                          "Fix window size" option. This doesn't change anything for the already
                          included games, but may help with future inclusions 
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX8:</b> IDirect3DDevice8::DrawIndexPrimitive and 
                          IDirect3DDevice8::DrawIndexPrimitiveUp are now hooked improving forced 
                          resolution compatibility. Forced resolution is now usable in Project Eden
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX9:</b> Added the "Borderless Fullscreen Window" option. This solves some 
                          bugs when forced resolution is enabled, like games crashing with alt-tab 
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX9:</b> Improved the "Fix window size" and added the "Resize window on 
                          device creation" options. The "Fix window size" option exists for all APIs to 
                          correctly resize the game window when forced resolution is enabled. On 
                          Direct3D9 it will never look like the game window was not correctly resized
                          - except if borderless fullscreen is enabled - because Direct3D9 will not 
                          clip the output to the window client area, but if the window is not correctly
                          resized, it will loose focus to the desktop when you click on it 
                          
                        <li><b>DirectX 10 and 11:</b> Added the "forced vsync" option
                        
                        <li><b>Opengl:</b> Improved forced resolution: The "resolution limit" option was added 
                          to handle games on which render resolution is not coupled with the display 
                          resolution. The functions glBitmap, glReadPixels, glDrawPixels, glReadRegion 
                          and glDrawRegion are now hooked. Improved the hooks on functions used to 
                          retrieve the display resolution and window size. Mouse hooks are now safe 
                          if called on a different thread then that making opengl calls
                        
                        <li><b>All APIs:</b> added a option to use a default replacement for all texture dumps 
                          missing a corresponding replacement
                          
                        <li>Extended the autodump option to Direct3D 7, 8 and 9 and opengl. This option
                          is still work in progress, but together with the option above, I can dump and 
                          replace several texture at once and this helps immensely to find and 
                          fix bugs. Texture swap as a whole now has a smaller CPU overhead and a much 
                          smaller memory overhead when dumps are not compiled 
                    </ul>      
                          
                    <p>Now some things that were fixed: </p>  
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li> Fixed autodump dumping all the mipmap levels on DirectX6 and earlier
                        <li> Fixed textures - and shaders - being dumped but not replaced in DirectX 10
                        <li> Fixed replacements not working except if they had the same number of mipmaps as the original texture on DirectX 10 and 11
                        <li> Fixed some textures being replaced, but the replacement being immediately discarded in Opengl - affects Anachronox 
                        <li> Fixed a bug loading compressed textures on Opengl
                        <li> Fixed crashes on Max Payne. This bug as quite nasty, because it would cause  the game to crash even if you tried to start it without peixoto's patch. The
                            "fix" disables texture swapping even if you enable it on the GUI, so it still needs improvement
                        <li> Fixed unresponsive menus on Die by the sword. This is a simple fix using the "QueryPerformanceCounter fix" option introduced in the previous update
                        <li> Fixed FMVs in Nocturne: the FMvs are now correctly upscaled. I'm aware of a extremely annoying issue in nocturne in the transition from gameplay to menus.
                             I'll try to fix it... eventually 
                        <li> Fixed a bug loading saves in Revenant  
                        <li> Fixed a memory leak on the MCI emulator                        
                    </ul>          
                                             
                    <p> Finally, 6 new games supported: </p>    
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Hyperblade: some glitches on the menus were fixed and also benefits from forced resolution and Super sampling anti-aliasing 
                        <li> Prince of persia and Bermuda Syndrome: not the original games but sld 
                          reimplementations of their engines: <a href='https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP'>SDL-POP</a> and
                          <a href='https://github.com/cyxx/bermuda'>bermuda</a> Both benefit from xBRz upscaling
                        <li> Blade of darkness: Fixed texts and the non working Gamma\Brighness\Conrtrast controls on Direct3D mode. 
                             Forced resolution and Super sampling anti-aliasing work on both Direct3D and OpenGl
                        <li> Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein-2009, both benefit from Forced resolution\Super sampling anti-aliasing

                    <h1 class='tile'>Version 0.10.7 - November, 10, 2021</h1>
                    <h3 class='tile'>This version was lost and is not included in the old versions download link</h3>
                    <pre> 
                      - Refactoring of the Direct3D (9 and earlier) user mode display driver hooks. 
                        These hooks are used to allow pixel shaders on Direct3D 7 and earlier, allow 
                        HLSL shaders on Direct3D 8, fix w fog on some Direct3D 7 and earlier games and
                        to fix a transparency bug on Star wars dark forces II. The refactoring aims to 
                        improve the maintainability of the code. This hooks will also be the base for 
                        future fixes related to alpha testing and z bias bugs in some games 
                        
                      - Improved the detection of transformed vertices on Direct3D 9 when forced 
                        resolution is enabled. Transformed vertices have to be correctly detected 
                        because they have to scaled on the CPU. 
                        
                      - Fixed a bug on the IDirect3DSurface8::GetDesc and 
                        IDirect3DDevice8::CreatePixelShader hooks that crashed some games
                        
                      - Improved compatibility of FidelityFx super resolution upscaling on both
                        Direct3D 11 and 12   
                        
                      - Added the QueryPerformanceCounter fix. This fix changes the behavior of the 
                        QueryPerformanceCounter function to report not the number of counts since 
                        windows was started, but since the current process was started. This was 
                        implemented to fix low frame rates on Jade empire, but i've heard of other 
                        games that need this as well. Since timeGetTime calls are redirected to 
                        QueryPerformanceCounter when the high resolution timers options is enabled, 
                        this option can fix games that use that function as well
                        
                      - Small refactoring of the Saves redirection feature. A new option to handle 
                        Xlive games was added. A code path that handled Unreal 1 and 2 games was 
                        removed, but instructions on how to adapt the system links option to these 
                        games were added  
                        
                      - Integrated a Fix created by others that disables TXAA on control   
                        
                      - Added 9 new games: 4 which benefit from forced resolution because they shrink
                        their UIs, HUD or texts on higher resolutions: Jade Empire, 
                        Start Trek Elite Force 2, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen and Enclave. 
                        2 which benefit from  FidelityFx super resolution: The Talos Priciple and 
                        Death's Door. Finally, another 2 games
                        on which forced resolution is not entirely necessary, but benefit from it because
                        it allows super sampling anti aliasing: Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force 
                        and Sudeki

                    <pre> 
                        - Direct3D 12 support added. Only one feature supported a the moment,
                          <a href='Https://Www.Amd.Com/En/Technologies/Radeon-Software-Fidelityfx-Super-Resolution'>FidelityFx super resolution</a>          
                
                        - Added FidelityFx super resolution to Direct3D 11 games and removed forced 
                          resolution in Direct3D 10 and 11 until it is in a more usable state 
                
                        - Added an option to set the affinity of threads making calls to Direct3D 8 to a
                          single core. This option was made to fix crashes in Soul Reaver 2 without 
                          causing sound glitches - setting single core affinity to the process frequently
                          causes it - and may be useful in other games too
                        
                        - Added FidelityFx super resolution to Unravel two
                
                        - Added Control - D3D11 and D3D12 - with FidelityFx super
